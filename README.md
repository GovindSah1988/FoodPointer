Build an iOS app with a map screen and a search bar (search bar on top and map view filling up the rest of the screen).
On entering a key like “Pizza” or “Coffee” in the search bar, it should show the nearest Pizza or Coffee shops on the map with pins.
On tapping of the pin, display an overlay with the name of the place.
On tapping the overlay, navigate the user to a new page with more details of the place (For example - telephone number, address, etc).

Important Points:
Use Apple maps.
Use Swift language.
